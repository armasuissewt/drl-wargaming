# MCTS

Implementation of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm for the 
experiments in the paper:

Giacomo, Del Rio and Oleg, Szehr and Alessandro, Antonucci and Matthias, Sommer and Michael, RuÃ«gsegger (2024) **"Deep Reinforcement Learning in Wargaming"**

## Environments

This MCTS algorithm that can work with
any [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html) environment that satisfies the
following two conditions:

1. the actions are discrete (`gymnasium.spaces.Discrete`)
2. the internal state of the environment can be saved/restored

The ability of saving and restoring the internal state of the environment can
be obtained in two ways:

- The environment is simple enough that a `copy.deepcopy` can do the job. In this
  case the environment can be used as-is and the MCTS algorithm will take care
  of making copies when needed.
- The environment itself implements the `save()` and `restore()` methods. This is
  usually needed when the environment is not pure Python code and needs extra
  processing to properly save and restore states.

## Usage

For usage examples see the [solvers](https://github.com/armasuissewt/drl-wargaming/tree/master/solvers) folder of the repository.
